There are three categories 
  Administrators
  Physical Therapists
  Patients

Permissions vary by category and are explained in Section2. In general, physical therapists and patients are the primary stakeholders.
Administrators’ access exists for maintenance and assistance purposes.

Formuals used for graphs:

      Description

      Formula

      Acceleration
      Magnitude

      HA=[HAx HAy HAz]
      BA= [BAx BAy BAz]

      The 2-norm of the acceleration signals; one for the handle vector and one for the base vector.

       HA2=HAx2+HAy2+HAz2
       BA2=BAx2+BAy2+BAz2

      Rotational Velocity Magnitude
      G=[Gx Gy Gz]

      The 2-norm of the rotational velocity signals; one for the handle vector.
       G2=Gx2+Gy2+Gz2

      Grip Pressure Sum
      f0, f1, …, f7

      The sum of the force signals produced by each FSR.
       fsum= f0+ f1+…+ f7

      Transverse Plane Rotational Velocity Magnitude
      GT=[Gx Gy]
      The 2-norm of the rotational velocity in the transverse plane.
       GT2= Gx2+Gy2
      Transverse Plane Acceleration Magnitude

      HAT=[HAx HAy]
      BAT= [BAx BAy]

      The 2-norm of the acceleration signals in the transverse plane; one for the handle vector and one for the base vector.
       HAT2=HAx2+HAy2   BAT2=BAx2+BAy2
